**THIS IS ONLY FOR THE BK GAMES STAFF MEMBERS**

Here at BK Games we take our staff team strictly to maintain Discord partnership and keep the server friendly for all


# Content:
As a staff member you have no rights to bypass the rules. Your role as a staff member is to help us as a team to moderate the server and ensure everyone is following the rules. Failure to abide by the rules will get you demoted


# Staff punishments:
Staff members can receive warnings. If you have received warnings previously, up to 2 can be removed. You can also receive staff warnings. These cannot be removed unless a mistake is made, or it is a temporary strike.

* 3 Staff Warnings = 1 Week demotion + Kick
* 6 Staff Warnings = 2 Week demotion = 7 Day Ban
* 9 Staff Warnings = Permanent demotion + 14 Day Ban

Hopefully none of you make it to 3 warnings, i know you wont. You're an amazing staff team



# Warning Rules:
As members collect warnings, there are some rules you must follow.

* When you have warned a member, check their logs after. This can be done by doing .warnings @member/userID


# Being professional:
This rule is mentioned alot. When giving warns/mutes to a member, you must use a professional reason. Failure will result in warnings. This is the most common ways people receive staff warnings

Unprofessional warns will be removed automatically. As a staff team you should stay professional


# Staff Applications:
Administrator - Head Adminstrator will need permission from High Rank Team to accept/deny applications (unless its a troll application)
You will be staff warned if you accept/deny without permission

High Rank Team can accept/reject freely


# Inactivity/breaks:
Taking breaks and being inactive is allowed. You must let Archh, Rayy or Alex know a day prior with how long, and why. All reasons will be accepted, as long as its not ridiculous. 

The reason we need to know is so that you dont get falsely accused of being inactive and losing your place as a staff member. 

When taking a break, dont say you will spend as much time on here as you can. Other members have it covered. Go enjoy what you are doing


# Promotions:
Promotions happen often, at least once a fortnight. Asking for one however will minimize the chance of you being promoted, and increase the chance of a demotion.

Staff get promotions for both being active (keeping chats alive) and moderating many members. I look for particularly activity more


# Demotions:
Demotions happen rarely, only when needed. Demotions are when a member goes down a role, or are removed from the staff team for a specific amount of time



# Staff Channels:
You have been given a variety of channels to use. Please use them to their purpose. Their name says their purpose, and so does the descriptions

Example: Moderation should be done in ‚Å†the Staff-CMDs channel

We wont warn for this unless it is constant


# Staff team management
The staff team here is managed by 3 members in particular

Staff Team: Alex, Arch
High Rank Team: Rayy


# Discord Partner Code of Conduct
You must abide by the Discord Partner Code of Conduct. Failing to do so will result in a demotion
